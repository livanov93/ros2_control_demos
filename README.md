This repository provides templates for the development of `ros2_control`-enabled robots and a simple simulation of a robot to demonstrate and prove `ros2_control` concepts.

## Goals

The repository has three goals:

1. Implements the example configuration described in the `ros-controls/roadmap` repository file [components_architecture_and_urdf_examples](https://github.com/ros-controls/roadmap/blob/master/design_drafts/components_architecture_and_urdf_examples.md).
2. It provides templates for faster start of implementing own hardware and controllers;
3. The repository is a validation environment for `ros2_control` concepts, which can only be tested during run-time (e.g., execution of controllers by the controller manager, communication between robot hardware and controllers).


## Description

The repository is inspired by [ros_control_boilerplate](https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/ros_control_boilerplate) repository from Dave Coleman.
The simulation has three parts/packages:
1. The first package, `ros2_control_demo_hardware`, implements the hardware interfaces described in the roadmap.
This implemented examples simulate *RRbot* internally to provide sufficient test and demonstration data, but to reduce amount of package dependencies.
This package does not have any dependencies except on the `ros2` core packages and can, therefore, be used on SoC-hardware of headless systems.
2. The second package, `ros2_control_demo_hardware_gazebo`, uses a gazebo simulator to simulate the *RRBot* and its physics.
This package is useful to test the connection of `ros2_control` to the gazebo simulator and to detect any missing plugins.
3. The third package holds examples for *RRbot* URDF-description, launch files and controllers.
The intention of those files is to simplify start with `ros2_control` and to enable faster integration of new robots and controllers.

This repository demonstrates the following `ros2_control` concepts:

* Creating of `*HardwareInterface` for a System, Sensor, and Actuator.
* Creating a robot description in the form of URDF files
* Loading configuration and starting robot using launch files 
* Control of two joints of *RRBot*
* Using simulated robots and starting `ros_control` with gazebo simulator
* Implementing of controller switching strategy for a robot
* Using joint limits and transmission concepts in `ros2_control`
* TBD...

# Getting Started with ROS2 Control

Each of the described example cases from the roadmap has its own launch and URDF file.
To start with the first example "Industrial Robots with only one interface" use following launch files:

```
ros2 launch ros2_control_demo_robot rrbot_system_position_only.launch.py
```

The other launch-files have corresponding names to their coresponding example.
The URDF files can be found in the `description` folder.
